## 0x1D C - Binary Trees
+ This repository contains solutions to the 0x1D C - Binary Trees project, which is part of the ALX Software Engineering program curriculum. The project involves writing C code to implement various operations on binary trees, including creating a binary tree, traversing a binary tree in different orders, and computing the height and size of a binary tree.
